# Regularization 
Regularization is a technique used to reduce errors by fitting the function appropriately on the given training set and avoiding overfitting. 

The commonly used regularization techniques are : 

# Lasso Regularization – L1 Regularization

A regression model which uses the L1 Regularization technique is called LASSO(Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression.


# Ridge Regularization – L2 Regularization

A regression model that uses the L2 regularization technique is called Ridge regression. Ridge regression adds the “squared magnitude” of the coefficient as a penalty term to the loss function(L).
